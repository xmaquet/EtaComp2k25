# Cursor rules for working with converted docs
- Always prefer using the files under docs/_converted when I reference @Files & Folders.
- When summarizing, produce concise bullet lists and preserve headings structure.
- Code examples should be idiomatic Python 3.11+ with type hints.
- Respect Ruff/Black formatting if you propose code changes.
